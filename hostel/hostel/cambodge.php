    The hostel called Cambodge is located just below Vietnam. It’s made of five houses which are<b><i> None, Oga, Rara, Sasa, and Pe</i></b>.
    
    Like <i><b>Vietnam, Dr Kwizera</b></i> said this hostel was constructed during the Cambodian civil war, which later resulted into genocide.
    </p>
<p>
    It is made of big rooms, with two single beds, and are better compared to the ones in <b>Vietnam. Cambodge</b> used to be a home for students who were in their <b>last year of university</b>.

“When you arrange these names like this:<b><i> None, Oga, Sasa, Rara, Pe (Today, Wash, arrange the bed, sleep, surely)</i></b> you get a meaning,<i><b>"Dr Kwizera said"</b></i>.
