    One of the most popular hostels, Titanic is located near Barthos Hotel was constructed in <b>1997 </b>when <b>Titanic, a Hollywood blockbuster</b> had just been released.</p>
    <p>

    <b><i>Dr Didas Kayihura,</i></b> a Lecturer in the School of Law, says that at the time the hostel was completed, Titanic was a very popular movie and that is how the hostel ended up being named after the famous movie.
    </p><p>
    “This hostel was very big compared to others in the campus at the time, just like the Titanic in the film,” he said. He added that all the names were invented by the students themselves.

“The institution has official names for the hostels, but they were not known as students applied theirs in relation to things which were making headlines,” he said.</p><br><br>
