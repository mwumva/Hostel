    <p>Vietnam or Viet is a hostel reserved for female students, made of six blocs just located under the main building known as <i>‘Batiment Central’</i>. 
      Each room has two single beds, a wardrobe and a bathroom and houses female students in second or third year.
      </p><br><p>
      <i><b>Dr Jean-Paul Kwizera</b></i>, a Senior Lecturer at the campus who is also a former student says the hostel was named so because it was opened in<b> 1975 </b>at the height of the Vietnamese war.
      </p>
    <p>
    The Vietnamese war which erupted after the Second World War was fiercely contested by communist North Vietnam supported by China and the Soviet Union against South capitalist Vietnam which was supported by USA with its allies like Australia, South Korea and Thailand among others.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    Vietnam is divided into six blocs named in the alphabetical order: <b>Aba, Bana, CyuraDawe, Ejo and Fumba.</b>
    
    According to Dr Kwizera, the bloc names form a meaningful phrase, like a short prayer to female students living there.
    
    <b>"Dawe Cyura Aba Bana Ejo"</b> <i>(Lord bring home these children tomorrow)</i>, it’s meaningful. Students especially the female ones meet various challenges before graduating. It’s like someone is wishing them well so as they return safe in their communities,” he said.
    </p><br> <font aria-setsize="15"><p>But nowadays,those names of the block are not known  by the students at all.</p></font>
    <p>However, Venantie Mukamunana, who studied at the college in the 1970s has a different story behind the name Viet, referring it to the very small number of female students at the time compared to male students.
    </p>
    <p>“Initially, female students were very few at that campus and we all lived in that hostel. 
    It was hard for male students to find girl friends among us and sometimes they could fight each other for girls. That’s how students started joking that getting a girlfriend in the campus required fighting a Vietnamese war,” she said.</p><br>
    
    <i><b>Mukamunana</b></i> recalls that in her particular class of languages, they were only <b>3</b> girls out of<b> 60</b> students.
    
    She further adds that the names of the other blocs referred to the names of <i>hills</i> located in <i><b>Huye district</b></i>.<br><br>    <?php
